# 📚 EDA on Book Data (Goodreads Dataset)

### 🧠 About the Project
This is my **second Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project**, where I analyzed a **Book Dataset** (inspired by Goodreads) to uncover patterns in **reader engagement, author performance, and book popularity**.

The goal of this project was to understand what factors influence a book’s success — such as ratings, reviews, number of pages, and publication patterns.


### 🎯 Objectives
This analysis explores key questions like:
1. Which authors consistently perform well?
2. Which publication companies generally perform better?
3. Which books are talked about the most?
4. Do books with more ratings also have higher average ratings?
5. Do longer books get better reviews?
6. Which books are rated the highest (considering fair review counts)?


### 🧩 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and aggregation  
- **NumPy** – Numeric processing  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis  


### 📊 Key Findings
- Highly discussed books belong mostly to **Fantasy** and **Emotional Fiction** genres (e.g., *Twilight*, *The Book Thief*).  
- **Popularity doesn’t always mean higher ratings**, but books with more readers show **more balanced feedback**.  
- **Longer books don’t guarantee higher ratings**, though well-written lengthy works perform well.  
- **Vintage** and **Penguin Books** lead as publishers with consistent quality and volume.  
- Authors like **P.G. Wodehouse** and **Rumiko Takahashi** maintain **steady performance** across multiple works.  


### 📈 Visualization Highlights
- Scatter plots showing correlation between ratings and engagement  
- Bar charts for publisher and author comparisons  
- Insights supported with annotated textual analysis  


### 🪶 Conclusion
This analysis reveals that:
- Emotional depth, storytelling, and author consistency drive engagement more than book length or rating count.  
- Trusted publishers and authors who balance productivity with quality achieve lasting reader satisfaction.
